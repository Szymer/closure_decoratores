# Python
- everything  i python is object
- function in python is first calls function 

#Clouser
- access to variables, function, classes form different (outer, actual retrieved.) scope
- variables are sotreed in function object


## Creation

1. Need to have min 2 functuion, one outer and one inner
2. Outer fuction shuldu return declartion of inner function
3. inner function have to use something from outer function (variable, other fucntion, class), and only this will be recorded 

## use case
- persistence (trwałośc)

## Cons
- if you not understand you can leak memory
